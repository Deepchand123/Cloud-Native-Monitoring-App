# Cloud-Native-Monitoring-App

The project utilized various tools and technologies, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, Amazon EKS, Docker, Jenkins, and Python Flask.

The main objective of the project was to create a Cloud Native Monitoring App that could effectively monitor real-time CPU and Memory usage within Docker containers. To achieve this, the project leveraged Python Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes. The deployment process was streamlined using Terraform, ensuring seamless deployment on Amazon ECR and Amazon EKS, thereby establishing a scalable infrastructure.

The key outcome of the project was the implementation of streamlined resource tracking, which significantly optimized the performance of the containerized applications.

# Architecture  of the Application

1. **Python Flask Application:** This formed the core of the Cloud Native Monitoring App, responsible for real-time CPU and Memory monitoring within Docker containers.

2. **Docker and Kubernetes:** Used for containerization and orchestration, respectively, to manage the deployment and scaling of the application components.

3. **Terraform:** Employed for infrastructure as code, facilitating the seamless deployment of the application on Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), ensuring a scalable and manageable infrastructure.

4. **Amazon EC2, ECS, and ECR:** Utilized for the deployment, management, and storage of containers, providing a reliable and scalable environment for the application.

5. **Jenkins:** Used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, enabling a more efficient and reliable software development workflow.
